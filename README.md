# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
# Define Software Engineering:
sotware engineering is a detailed study of science  to the design, development and maintenance of software

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering emphasizes on scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems.TRaditional Programming, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
this is a  cost-effective and time-efficient software development process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
# SIX PHASES
Phase one :REQUIREMENTS
seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. In this phase, the team is looking to answer, “What are the expectations of our users from our software?” This is called requirements gathering.The project team collects information from stakeholders, including analysts, users, and clients.his analysis helps the team understand the software’s functionality, performance, security, and interface needs

Phase 2.DESIGN
its all about building the framework,This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently.Key activities include crafting data flow diagrams, constructing entity-relationship diagrams, and designing user interface mock-ups

Phase3:IMPLEMENTATION
is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.This development phase aims to develop software that is functional, efficient, and user-friendly. Developers use an appropriate programming language, Java or otherwise, to write the code, guided by the SDD and coding guidelines. This document, acting as a roadmap, ensures the software aligns with the vision set in earlier phases

PHASE4: TESTING
 rigorous quality inspection on a production line. It is when vulnerabilities are uncovered. Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding. The aim is to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end-users. And even identify opportunities for enhancement.The testing process begins by setting clear parameters in line with the software’s requirements

PHASE5: DEPLOYMENT
The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users,by pushing to the production environment.

PHASE6: MAINTENANCE
This phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

# Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. When implementing an agile model, requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and adaptation to change. 
While the waterfall model  is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step. The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
# KEY DIFFERENCES 
1. Waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental.
2.Waterfall involves customers mainly at the beginning and end,while agile has customer involvement all through the development process.
3.Agile model is quick adaptive to changes unlike waterfall which is rigid with fixed phases
4.Agile entails continous testing throughout the development cycle ,while waterfall testing is typically done after implementation.
# SCENARIOS OF PREFERENCE
Waterfall model preferred when:
(i)Projects with well-defined, stable requirements unlikely to change.
(ii)projects with clear scope and goals from the Genesis.
(iii)Projects which are short term
agile model are preferred when:
(i)Dealing with longterm projects.
(ii)Projects with stipulated requirement changes
(iii)projects requiring continuous user feedback and validation, such as consumer applications.

# Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system

 Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
# Process of requirements engineering
(i).Feasibility Study
Evaluates project viability by analyzing technical, economic, legal, and operational aspects to determine if it is worth pursuing
(ii).Requirements elicitation
Collects user needs and expectations through interviews, surveys, and observation to understand the desired system functionalities and constraints
(iii).Requirements specification
Documents detailed requirements in a formal, clear, and precise manner, often using structured templates, to guide development and design.
(iv).Requirements for verification and validation
Ensures requirements are correctly defined and meet user needs through reviews, inspections, and testing, maintaining alignment with project goals.
(v).Requirements management
Tracks and controls requirements changes throughout the project lifecycle to ensure consistency and traceability, facilitating project adaptability and progress.
# IMPORTANCE OF REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING
(i).Helps ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders
(ii).help identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant 
(iii).Helps ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner
(iv) helps improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders
(v) Helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.

# Software Design Principles:

#Explain the concept of modularity in software design:
it is a design priciple in software engineering where  a sytem is divided into distinct , self-contained units callled modules.Each module encapsulates a specific piece of functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.
 #How does it improve :
 maintainability;Modularity makes it easier to understand , modify and debug individual modules without affecting the entire sytem.It allows for isolated changes and enhances code readability
scalability of software systems?
modules can be developed, tested and deployed independently, enabling the system to grow and evolve incrementally.It supports the addition  of new features and scaling of existing ones without disrupting the whole system.
# Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
(i)unit testing
Tests individual components or modules for correctness and functionality.
(ii) intergration testing
Ensures combined modules or systems work together as intended.
(iii) system testing
